# Usage
First run the program: \
`python chessSearch.py` 

Next you can enter a query of the form \
`start_x start_y end_x end_y piece`

ie:
`0 0 7 7 knight`

This will display the minimum number of moves required for a knight to get from the start position of (0,0) to the goal position of (7,7).

the list of pieces implemented are as follows: \
`[king | bishop | knight]`

The board is parameterized by positions of the form: \
`(0 <= x <= 7, 0 <= y <= 7)`

To quit enter one of the following commands. 

`q | quit | exit`
